#### Summary

This was the first project i had fully scoped out before starting to write. Because of this
i ran into a lot of frustrations and a lot more tinkering than previous projects. Ultimatly it taught me
to push through the frustrations to find a solution, especialy if the code was fundametal to what i had scoped out
in the beginning.
